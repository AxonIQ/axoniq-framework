/**
 * Annotation that indicates that a method or constructor is a factory method for an event-sourced entity, forcing
 * creation at all times.
 * <p>
 * It is meta-annotated with {@link EntityCreator} to support all behavior as described on the {@code EntityCreator}.
 * What this annotation adds, is the assurance that <b>if</b> sufficient information is available to invoke the
 * annotated method or constructor, that it will be invoked regardless of downstream usages of the entity itself. This
 * adjusts the regular behavior of the no-arguments, identifier-only, and event-based {@code EntityCreator} solutions
 * like so:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>A no-arguments, {@code @EntityCreator} annotated constructor or method, will always create the entity.</li>
 *     <li>An identifier-based, {@code @EntityCreator} annotated constructor or method, will create if an identifier can be resolved.</li>
 *     <li>An event-based, {@code @EntityCreator} annotated constructor or method, will <b>only</b> create if an initial event is present.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * This additional behavior becomes important for create-if-missing styled handlers. For plain {@code EntityCreator}
 * solutions, the create-if-missing handler should either (1) be {@code static} (read: marked as a creational handler)
 * when present in the entity itself or (2) moved out of the entity entirely. In both scenarios the create-if-missing
 * behavior would require the entity as a parameter to the message handling function validate if it does exist. If
 * optional subsequent decisions require life state changes of the potentially missing entity, the user is enforced to
 * inject a {@link org.axonframework.modelling.repository.ManagedEntity} instead.
 * <p>
 * This annotation adjusts that behavior, by simply invoking the {@code @ForcedEntityCreator} annotated constructor or
 * method and passing it through. This will effectively make the entity non-null for all no-argument scenarios and most
 * identifier-based scenarios. Furthermore, it allows the create-if-missing solution to work on instance command
 * handlers placed in the entity, resolving the need to make them {@code static}.
 * <p>
 * Note that this forced-creation-approach is viewed as an aggregate-centric solution, whereas this library aims to
 * steer away from that. Hence, any opportunity to use other mechanisms than this are encouraged.
