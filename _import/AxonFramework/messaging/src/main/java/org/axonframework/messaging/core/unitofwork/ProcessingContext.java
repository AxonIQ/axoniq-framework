     * The {@code resourceSupplier} MUST NOT call {@link #computeResourceIfAbsent(ResourceKey, Supplier)} or
     * {@link #putResourceIfAbsent(ResourceKey, Object)} on this {@code ProcessingContext}. The backing resource store
     * rejects re-entrant structural modification and will throw {@link IllegalStateException} (surfacing as a
     * "Recursive update"). This matters when stacking decorators that each cache their wrapped instance per
     * {@code ProcessingContext}: resolve the dependency on the delegate <em>before</em> entering the supplier, rather
     * than from within it.
     * <p>
     * <b>Warning:</b> never use this method for a resource whose construction closes over (holds a reference to)
     * this {@code ProcessingContext} itself - construct a fresh instance directly on every call instead - unless
     * {@code key} is guaranteed to be one of the resources every possible branch of this context overrides. A
     * "branch" here is any {@code ProcessingContext} returned by {@link #withResource(ResourceKey, Object)}: a
     * {@link ResourceOverridingProcessingContext} that overrides one specific resource key on top of a shared
     * parent. Such a branch only intercepts {@code computeResourceIfAbsent} for its own overridden key; every other
     * key falls through to the shared parent, ultimately the root context. If the supplied instance holds onto
     * {@code context}, and {@code context} may be one of several sibling branches of a shared parent (for example,
     * one branch per message being handled within a shared batch), the first branch to call this method gets its
     * instance cached on the shared root, and every sibling branch that calls afterward receives that <em>same</em>
     * stale instance back - silently operating against the wrong branch. For example, this is unsafe:
     * <pre>{@code
     * // UNSAFE: MyContextAwareGateway's constructor stores a reference to "context".
     * static MyContextAwareGateway forContext(ProcessingContext context) {
     *     return context.computeResourceIfAbsent(RESOURCE_KEY, () -> new MyContextAwareGateway(context));
     * }
     * }</pre>
     * If {@code context} is a per-message branch of a batch, the second message to call {@code forContext} receives
     * the first message's gateway back, closed over the first message's branch. Supply a fresh instance directly
     * instead, bypassing this resource store entirely:
     * <pre>{@code
     * // SAFE: always supplies a fresh instance bound to whichever context is passed in.
     * static MyContextAwareGateway forContext(ProcessingContext context) {
     *     return new MyContextAwareGateway(context);
     * }
     * }</pre>
     * <p>
     * This method remains the correct choice when the cached value does <em>not</em> reference {@code context} and
     * is genuinely meant to be shared for the whole processing session, regardless of how many branches exist. For
     * example:
     * <pre>{@code
     * // SAFE: the cached ConcurrentHashMap never references "context", and is meant to be
     * // shared across every branch of the same processing session.
     * var managedEntities = context.computeResourceIfAbsent(managedEntitiesKey, ConcurrentHashMap::new);
     * }</pre>
