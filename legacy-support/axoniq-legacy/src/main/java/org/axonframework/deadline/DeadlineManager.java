/**
 * Contract for deadline managers. Contains methods for scheduling a deadline and for cancelling a deadline.
 * <p>
 * The overloads that take no {@link ScopeDescriptor} use {@link Scope#describeCurrentScope()}, as in Axon Framework
 * 4. A Saga is the current {@link Scope} while one of its handler methods runs, so calling them from a Saga handler
 * schedules or cancels within that Saga's scope, regardless of how the {@code DeadlineManager} was obtained. Calling
 * them while no scope is active throws an {@link IllegalStateException}.
 * <p>
 * This contract exists to keep deadlines that were scheduled with Axon Framework 4 firing while migrating. Scheduling
 * new deadlines is therefore deprecated, while cancelling them stays fully supported.
