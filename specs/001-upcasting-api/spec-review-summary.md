# Event Transformation API: Spec Summary

**Feature**: Axoniq Framework 5.2.0, issue AxonIQ/axoniq-framework#137 (ported from AxonIQ/AxonFramework#3597)
**Branch**: `enhancement/137/implementation-message-transformator`

## What problem does it solve?

Event-sourced systems store events permanently and immutably, but applications evolve. When schemas change, old stored events must still work with new code. AF5 handles this with two layered mechanisms:

1. **Message converter**. Handles representation changes (adding optional fields, renaming via aliases, type coercion, etc.) automatically.
2. **Message transformer** *(this spec)*. Handles structural changes the converter can't (splits, drops, required fields, payload restructuring).

The transformer is wired in front of routing/dispatch at three sites: a decorator around the `EventStore` for events, around the command bus connector for incoming commands, and around the query bus connector for incoming queries. The same SPI shape (`MessageStream<M> -> MessageStream<M>`) handles all three. Ships from `axoniq-framework` (commercial).

## Scope (the three-part structure)

- **Part A, Converter-only**: decision tree showing what the converter handles natively (no transformer needed).
- **Part B, Transformer needed**: 9 user stories, the heart of the spec.
- **Part C, Out of scope**: deferred features and scenarios where a transformer is the wrong tool.

### Part A: What the converter handles (no transformer needed)

The converter absorbs most schema evolution on its own through two mechanisms: **payload
conversion at handling time** (each handler declares its preferred Java type and the converter
produces it from the stored payload) and **converter-level compatibility configuration** (Jackson
annotations, Avro reader/writer schemas, JAXB bindings, defaults, ignore-unknown settings, all
on the converter, never on the transformation chain).

So **whether a change requires a transformer depends as much on how your converter is configured
as on the change itself.** A loose configuration absorbs more; a strict one rejects more.

> **The rule:** configure your converter first; reach for a transformer only when the change
> cannot be expressed there.


### User Stories (Part B)

| # | Story | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| US1 | Structural payload transformation (e.g. `capacity` -> `min/maxCapacity`) | P1 |
| US2 | MessageType rename / version bump, payload unchanged | P2 |
| US3 | Event splitting (1 event -> N events, ordered) | P3 |
| US4 | Event dropping (1 -> 0, tracking token still advances) | P4 |
| US5 | Chaining transformations across versions (v1 -> v2 -> v3) | P2 |
| US6 | Misconfiguration & runtime failure feedback (fail fast, clear errors) | P1 |
| US7 | Startup observability (INFO at boot, DEBUG per event) | P2 |
| US8 | Command transformation (1:1 only; reject splits/drops) | P3 |
| US9 | Query transformation (1:1 only; reject splits/drops) | P3 |

### Deferred / Out of Scope (Part C)

- **Deferred**: N-to-1 merge, moving data between events, sender-side transformation, snapshot transformation, annotation-based registration. Each has a documented "memory-scope" or "scope/focus" reason, with guidance on what to do instead (often: Copy-and-Replace migration, or stateful projection).
- **Wrong tool**: silent semantic-meaning changes, and events that can't be derived from the old payload. Both corrupt the audit trail. Solution: a new event type.

## Functional Requirements (highlights)

- **FR-001/002/003**: 1:1 transformations (source + target + optional rule), pure renames (no rule), and 1:N/1:0 (split/drop) patterns.
- **FR-004**: Registration is programmatic and startup-only; chain locks once processing begins; registration order = application order.
- **FR-005**: Exact `MessageType` (`QualifiedName` + `version`) matching, by string equality; non-matching events pass through. Naming consistency with the configured `MessageTypeResolver` is the user's responsibility; the framework does not enforce a naming convention.
- **FR-006**: Transformations must be deterministic and thread-safe (contract, not enforced).
- **FR-007**: Per-`QualifiedName` sub-chains; non-matching events skip the chain (O(1)); 1:N outputs re-enter their own sub-chain.
- **FR-008**: Four hard-error classes detected before any event is processed. Duplicate `from`, self-loop (at `register()`), multi-step cycle, version-order violation (at `.build()` lock). Naming mismatches are not detectable at startup and are the user's responsibility.
- **FR-009**: Developer-chosen target type resolved via `Converter` (typically structured: `JsonNode`, POJO; `byte[]` permitted).
- **FR-010**: Message envelope (entity id, token, sequence) preserved; 1:N outputs share input's token + sequence (no renumber); metadata may be modified.
- **FR-011**: Lazy deserialization. Non-matching events never deserialized; O(1) per-event lookup, no allocations on the non-matching path (benchmark thresholds in plan.md).
- **FR-012**: Same output across all three read contexts (entity load, DCB read, tracking processor).
- **FR-013**: DEBUG once at startup; TRACE per applied transformation; observability can be disabled entirely.
- **FR-014**: Tracking token advances past dropped events.
- **FR-015**: Exceptions propagate immediately with full context; no silent skip.
- **FR-016**: Unversioned legacy events treated as version `0.0.1`.
- **FR-017**: Unit-testable without bootstrapping the framework.
- **FR-018**: Output identity verified against declared `to`; no silent coercion (1:1 only).
- **FR-019**: Mechanism extends to commands and queries; splits/drops rejected for those.
- **FR-020**: Optional `VersionComparator` (default: registration order alone); `SemverComparator` ships as a builder convenience; when registered, enforces version-order at lock time.
- **FR-021**: Data-protection (PII redaction etc.) runs *after* the transformer.

## Success Criteria (highlights)

- **SC-002**: Every FR-008 conflict class detected before any event processed.
- **SC-003**: All in-scope use cases demonstrated in `axoniq-framework/examples/` with passing CI tests.
- **SC-008**: Concurrency test, multiple threads x sufficient iterations produce identical outputs (specific N/M in plan.md).
- **SC-009**: DEBUG (startup) + TRACE (per applied) observability + disable mechanism verified by automated tests.

## Key design choices worth a reviewer's attention

1. **Programmatic registration only** for 5.2.0. Explicit reaction to AF4's Spring-Bean ordering issues. Annotations deferred.
2. **Fail-fast philosophy**. Three FR-008 misconfiguration classes caught at startup (`register()` + `.build()` lock); a fourth class (version-order violation) is added when an optional `VersionComparator` is registered (FR-020).
3. **No context-aware transformations**. N-to-1 merge and field-borrowing across events deferred because per-entity vs. cross-entity memory scope was a known AF4 bug source.
4. **Single SPI for events, commands, queries**. `MessageTransformer<M extends Message<?>>` operating on `MessageStream<M>`, wired in front of routing/dispatch at three sites (`EventStore` + command/query bus connectors). Split/drop restricted to events.
5. **Snapshots architecturally ready but deferred**. Design must not preclude future snapshot transformations without redesign.
6. **Commercial-only feature**. Ships from `axoniq-framework`; pure Axon Framework users must add the dependency. `axon-framework` itself stays untouched except for one small `MessageStream.flatMap` addition needed by the chain implementation.
